# Introduction
The EKEEL Transcriber Service is a continuous transcription system that. 

It automates the process of converting YouTube videos into text transcripts using the Stable-Whisper model (large-v3), a state-of-the-art speech recognition model.

The service operates as a background worker that continuously polls a MongoDB database for untranscribed video jobs. 

For each video, it:
    
- Downloads the video from YouTube.
- Converts it into WAV format.
- Transcribes the audio using Whisper, generating accurate, multilingual text segments.
- Updates the database with the transcription and cleans up temporary files.
